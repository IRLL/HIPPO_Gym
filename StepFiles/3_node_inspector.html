    <h1>Node Inspector</h1>
    
<p>It's hard to make good decision when you can't see what you will get! Fortunately, you will have access to a <b><em>node inspector</em></b> which can reveal the value of a node. To use the node inspector, <b><em>simply click on a node.</em></b>. The image below illustrates how this works.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> you can only use the node inspector when you're on the first node.</p>
