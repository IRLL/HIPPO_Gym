    <h1>Node Inspector</h1>
    
    <p>It's hard to make good decision when you can't see what you will get! Fortunately, you will have access to a <b>node inspector</b> which can reveal the value of a node. To use the node inspector, simply <b>click on a node</b>. The image below illustrates how this works.  <p></p>

    <p> <b>Note:</b> you can only use the node inspector when you're on the first node as pictured in the image below.  <p></p>
