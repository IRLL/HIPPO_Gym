    <h1>Node Inspector</h1>
    
    <p>At the start of every round, the value of all the nodes are hidden. This makes it difficult to determine the best path for the plane to take. Fortunately, you will have access to a <b>node inspector</b> which can reveal the value of a node. To use the node inspector, simply <b>click on a node</b>. The image below illustrates how this works.  <p></p>

    <p> <b>Note:</b> you can only use the node inspector when you're on the first node as pictured in the image below. Once you move the plane, you CANNOT inspect anymore nodes.<p></p>
