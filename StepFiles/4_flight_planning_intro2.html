    <h1>Flight Planning</h1>
    
<p>The flight planning game is a metaphor for life.</p>
<p>The central circle that you start from represents your present circumstances. The six circles at the end of each path represent your possible futures. The circles in-between show the different paths you can take and how rewarding or unrewarding they are in the short-term.</p>
<p>Whenever you move to the circle, the value inside of it is added to your total score.</p>
