    <h1>Flight Planning</h1>
    
    
<p>In this study, you can practice your planning skills in order to make better decisions in a simple game called Flight Planning. You will navigate an airplane across a network
        of airports (gray circles). The value inside each circle shows you how profitable it is to fly there. When you land on a gray circle (a node), the value of the node is added to your total score.

</p>    
    
<p>You will be able to move the plane with the arrow keys, but only in the direction of the arrows between the nodes. The image below shows the network of airports.</p>
