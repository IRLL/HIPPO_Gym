    <h1>How to make better decisions?</h1>
    
    
    <p> As we go through our lives we are often drawn to immediate pleasures and avoid doing things that are unpleasant. For instance, we watch a Youtube video because it promises immediate fun, but we put off filing our taxes because it feels boring. </p>
    <p> However, in order to make better decisions, it is important that we think about future outcomes and plan ahead. </p>
