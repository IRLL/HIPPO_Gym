	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>Fingerprints can be classified into impressions and latent Fingerprints.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Fingerprint impressions are acquired under controlled conditions and have high quality.</li>
		<li>
			Latent fingerprints are unintentionally left by someone when manipulating objects and have low
			quality.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Latent fingerprint identification aims to search a background database for impressions that are
		similar to a given query. Latent fingerprint indentification is usually related to forensic
		applications and has success rates as low as 71.32%. Consequently, latent fingerprint
		identification is an area of constant evolution, aiming to find new methods that help obtain
		better identification rates.
		<br />
		Minutiae are the basic features used to represent fingerprints.
	</p>
	<h2>What is this study about?</h2>
	<p>
		This project will train an artificial intelligence agent to predict the impact of including or
		excluding each minutia for a latent fingerprint identification system. Based on this new agent,
		we will use a human-in-the-loop approach to develop a system to improve minutiae labeling for
		latent fingerprint identification.<br />
		You are being asked to take part because you fall in our specified age range (over 18 years old)
		and have the basic knowledge in operating a computer that is necessary for the data collection.
		<br />
		Depending on the configuration of the study you are taking part in, it can take about 15-40
		minutes.
	</p>
	<h2>Are there any benefits to me if I am in this study</h2>
	<p>
		There is no direct benefit to you from being in this study. <br />

		However, through this study, we aim to develop a novel software package that will serve both as
		a training tool for people with little or no experience in latent fingerpeint identification and
		as a useful tool for the senoir latent fingerprint examiners.
