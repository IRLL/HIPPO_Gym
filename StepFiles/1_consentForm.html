<h2>Invitation to Participate:</h2>
<p>We invite you to participate in this study about analyzing how people make decisions and
        investigating strategies to improve human decision-making.</p>

<h2>Purpose of the Study:</h2>
<p>This study aims to show that we can teach humans how to make better long-term decisions and
        avoid acting myopically. By acting myopically better decisions, we mean making decisions that help only in the short term
        how to act in a given situation so that the long-term advantage of taking such an action is maximized.</p>

<h2>Participation:</h2>
<p>: If you wish to participate in this study, you will be asked to first complete a short survey on your
        decision-making strategies. Next, you will complete a second task in which you will be interacting with a game. During the
        game, you will be provided feedback on how to improve your decision-making in the game. This is followed by another short
        survey. The study should take you approximately 30 minutes to complete. You do not have to answer any questions that you
        are not comfortable with. However, you must answer all attention check questions. You may stop at any point by closing the
        window and no data further data will be collected. Any data collected from previous components will be deleted. You will still
        receive the default compensation for completing the previous sub-tasks successfully. However, to receive the entire
        compensation of $7.50, you must complete all three tasks together (i.e., no stopping between tasks).</p>

<h2>Benefits:</h2>
<p>There are no direct benefits of taking part in this study except for (hopefully) enjoying these different tasks.</p>

<h2>Risks:</h2>
<p> This study involves minimal risk which includes minor fatigue due to the concentration required to finish the task.
        There is also the normal risk of interacting with a computer, e.g., long-term symptoms from muscle reuse like carpel tunnel
        syndromes. You can withdraw from the study at any point till submitting the response.
</p>

<h2>Confidentiality and Anonymity:</h2>
<p> All results from the study will remain confidential. We will only use results from the study
        for the purposes of this research. The only people who will have access to the research data are the Principal Investigators
        and researchers working on this study. Results will be published in pooled (aggregate) format. Your data will be anonymous
        as you will not provide your name or any personal information.</p>

<h2>Data Storage:</h2>
<p> The results will come from the surveys and logs based on your game performance. This data will be stored
        in AWS S3 within their Canadian data centers. It will be stored for at least 5 years following the completion of the study. Only
        researchers on this project will get access to this data. If you would like to withdraw your data from the study, please email
        us using the email address provided. To complete this removal request, you must send us an email within 30 days of
        completing the study. In such email, you must include the UUID you received during the study on the instructions and final
        page. If you request removal of your data, you will still retain any incentive earned.</p>

<h2>Compensation (or Reimbursement):</h2>
<p>
        Participants will be paid a compensation of $7.50 for completing the entire study. To
        receive the full $7.50 payment, you must complete all 3 components of the study. However, you will receive partial payment
        for completing individual components of the study as outlined in detail below. Also, you must answer all attention check
        questions correctly. You will be prompted by the system if you fail any of the attention check questions. If this occurs, you will
        get one more opportunity to answer the attention check questions correctly. If you fail to do so, you will be forced to quit the
        study at that point, but you will still get any incentive previously earned. This is outlined in detail under Task 1 below. Our
        expectation is that anyone who puts forth a good effort (e.g., not multi-tasking or watching television) will easily pass such
        checks. Also, participants can receive a performance-based bonus of $1.50. Participants will receive a bonus of $0.01 for
        every in-game score of 5. For example, if the participant gets a score of 500, their bonus will be (500/5)*0.01 = $1.00.
</p>
<p>We have task-specific compensation for completing each task as outlined below:</p>

<p>
<b>Task 1:</b>
If you complete the first task, you will be paid $0.50 as compensation. This task should take 5 min on average to
complete. This task involves answering survey questions and reading through the game instructions. You will have to
answer the attention check questions correctly to go to the next task. You will have two attempts to get 100% on all attention
check questions. If you fail to answer all attention check questions correctly, then the study will end, and you will only receive
$0.50 as compensation.
</p>

<p>
<b>Task 2:</b>

In the second task, you will be interacting with a game. You will be receiving feedback to improve your score on the
game. There will be 30 rounds in total. This task should take 15 minutes on average to complete. If you complete the second
task, you will receive $6.50. During this phase, you will receive a bonus of $0.01 for every in-game score of 5. For example,
if you get a score of 500, then your bonus will be (500/5)*0.01 = $1.00. The maximum bonus is $1.50. You will be told your
bonus amount at the completion of this task.
</p>

<p>
<b>Task 3:</b>
In the final task, you will answer another round of survey questions. This task should take approximately 5 min to
complete. If you complete this last task, you will receive $0.50.
</p>


<p><b>As a reminder, you cannot proceed to the next task without completing the previous task. So, if you only complete
        Task 1 and then withdraw from the study, you will only receive the $0.50 payment. The same goes for Task 2. If you
        only complete Task 1 and Task 2 and not the final Task 3 and then withdraw from the study, you will only receive the
        combined $7.00 payment and any bonus amount you received from Task 2</b></p>
        
<h2>Voluntary Participation:</h2>
<p>You are under no obligation to take part and if you choose to, you may refuse to answer questions that you do not want to
        answer, except for the attention check questions. Should you choose to withdraw midway through the electronic survey
        simply close the link and no further responses will be included. We will also delete any data collected from previous
        components. You will still receive the default compensation for completing the previous sub-tasks successfully. However, to
        receive the entire compensation of $7.50, you must complete all three tasks together (i.e., no stopping between tasks).</p>

<h2>Information about the Study Results:</h2>
<p>We will publish the study results in an academic paper. This paper will be made publicly available through the websites of
        the investigators. If you would like to receive the results of the study, please contact us.</p>

<h2>Contact Information:</h2>

<p>
If you have any questions or need any more information about the study itself, please contact us. You may contact the
researchers at the emails mentioned above. The plan for this study has been reviewed by a Research Ethics Board at the
