<h2>Invitation to Participate:</h2>
<p>We invite you to participate in this study about analyzing how people make decisions and investigating strategies to improve human decision-making.</p>

<h2>Purpose of the Study:</h2>
<p>This study aims to show that we can teach humans how to make better long-term decisions and avoid acting myopically. By acting myopically, we mean making decisions that help only in the short term.</p>

<h2>Participation:</h2>
<p>If you wish to participate in this study, you will be asked to first complete a short survey on your decision-making strategies. Next, you will complete a second task in which you will be interacting with a game. During the game, you will have feedback on how to improve your decision-making. This is followed by another short survey. The study should take you approximately 30 minutes to complete. You do not have to answer any questions that you are not comfortable with. However, you must answer all attention check questions. You may stop at any point by closing the window and no further data will be collected. Any data collected from previous components will be deleted.</p>

<h2>Benefits:</h2>
<p>There are no direct benefits of taking part in this study except for (hopefully) enjoying these different tasks.</p>

<h2>Risks:</h2>
<p> This study involves minimal risk which includes minor fatigue due to the concentration required to finish the task.
        There is also the normal risk of interacting with a computer, e.g., long-term symptoms from muscle reuse like carpel tunnel
        syndromes. You can withdraw from the study at any point till submitting the response.
</p>

<h2>Confidentiality and Anonymity:</h2>
<p> All results from the study will remain confidential. We will only use results from the study for the purposes of this research. The only people who will have access to the research data are the Principal Investigators and researchers working on this study. Results will be published in pooled (aggregate) format. Your data will be anonymous as you will not provide your name or any personal information.</p>

<h2>Data Storage:</h2>
<p> The results will come from the surveys and logs based on your game performance. This data will be stored in AWS S3 within their Canadian data centers. It will be stored for at least 5 years following the completion of the study. Only researchers on this project will get access to this data. If you would like to withdraw your data from the study, please email us using the email address provided. To complete this removal request, you must send us an email within 30 days of completing the study. In such email, you must include the UUID you received during the study on the instructions and final page. If you request removal of your data, you will still retain any incentive earned.</p>



<h2>Voluntary Participation:</h2>
<p>You are under no obligation to take part and if you choose to, you may refuse to answer questions that you do not want to answer, except for the attention check questions. Should you choose to withdraw midway through the electronic survey simply close the link and no further responses will be included. We will also delete any data collected from previous components.</p>

<h2>Information about the Study Results:</h2>
<p>We will publish the study results in an academic paper. This paper will be made publicly available through the websites of the investigators. If you would like to receive the results of the study, please contact us.</p>

<h2>Contact Information:</h2>

<p>
If you have any questions or need any more information about the study itself, please contact us. You may contact the researchers at the emails mentioned above. The plan for this study has been reviewed by a Research Ethics Board at the
University of Alberta, ethics ID number Pro00122796. If you have any questions regarding your rights as a research participant or how the research is being conducted, you may contact the Research Ethics Office via email at reoffice@ualberta.ca.
