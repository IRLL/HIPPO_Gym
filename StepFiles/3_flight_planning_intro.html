    <h1>Flight Planning</h1>
    
    
<p>In this study, you can practice your planning skills to make better decisions in a simple game called Flight Planning. You will navigate an airplane across a network of airports (white circles). Each circle has a value denoting how profitable it is to fly there. When you land on a circle (a node), the value of the node is revealed and added to your total score.

</p>    
    
<p>You will be able to move the plane with the arrow keys, but only in the direction of the arrows between the nodes. The image below shows the network of airports.</p>
