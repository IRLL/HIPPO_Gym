    <h1>Practice makes perfect</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>You can get better at planning through practice.</li>
        <li>You will begin with a pre-test of 2 game rounds. This will give us (the researchers) a better understanding on your starting game performance. </li>
        <li>This will be followed by 20 practice rounds. During these practice trials, an intelligent tutor will give you helpful feedback on how to decide what to do.</li>
        <li>After the practice trials, there will be a test block of 10 rounds. During this test block, the intelliegent tutor <b>will not be available</b>. The goal is to use what you have learned during the practice rounds to help improve your test score.</li>
        <li>The higher your score is in the test block, the higher your bonus will be.</li> 
    </ul>
